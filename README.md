# Wiperblades

This is a minimal colour scheme for Vim that I created.
It is designed to use default terminal colours, though it also defines GUI colours that are roughly equivalent.
In creating this scheme, I took inspiration from [Nofrils](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils) and [Paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount).

While in the process of creating it, I named the scheme `wip`, for "work-in-progress", so when it came time to pick a proper name, I wanted to keep `wip` as a prefix.
That's where the name `wiperblades` comes from.
