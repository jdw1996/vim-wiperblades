# Wiperblades

This is a minimal colour scheme for Vim that I created.
It is designed to use default terminal colours, though it also defines GUI colours that are roughly equivalent.
In creating this scheme, I took inspiration from [Nofrils](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils) and [Paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount).

If you have any questions or suggested improvements, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/vim-wiperblades/issues/new).
